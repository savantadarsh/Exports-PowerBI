### **B. Product Performance: Strengths and Weaknesses**

**Findings**:

- Lower performers: Sweatshirt (¬£52.2M) and T-Shirt (¬£48.1M)
- Price points vary from ¬£6 to ¬£40 per unit

**Business Implications**:
- Sweatshirt and T-shirt sales underperformance may indicate pricing, branding, or market positioning issues. Strategies such as discounts, redesigns, or promotional bundles could improve demand.
- Jacket, Cardigan, and Hoodie sales dominance suggests potential expansion opportunities, such as introducing premium, limited-edition, or region-specific variations.

**How the Dashboard Helps**:
- The **Revenue by Product Category Chart** clearly distinguishes top-performing and underperforming products.

‚öñÔ∏è **Pricing and Cost Optimisation**: Enables informed decisions around pricing strategy or cost control initiatives to improve profit margins per product.

**ToolTip Insights**
- Jackets and Hoodies contribute significantly to both top-line revenue and bottom-line profit. Jackets, despite lower volume, deliver exceptional returns due to premium pricing. Hoodies provide balanced volume and profitability.
- T-shirts and Sweatshirts are low-margin, high-volume products. While they aid total unit sales, they do not contribute as efficiently to profitability.

**Investment Suggestion**
- Continue prioritising premium products like Jackets for margin maximisation, and Hoodies for volume-plus-profit stability. Ensure consistent availability and targeted marketing during peak demand
- Use T-Shirts and Sweatshirts as entry-level or promotional products to boost volume and attract new customers, but do not rely on them for driving profits. Consider bundling them with higher-margin items.
