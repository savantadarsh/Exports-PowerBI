## **3. Key Insights and Business Implications**

### **A. Sales & Profit Trends Across 2024**

**Findings**:
- Total Revenue: £1.04B
- Total Units Sold: 62.23M
- Profit Margin: 44.92%
- Highest weekly revenue reached ~£22M; sharp dip to £3M and £0.16M toward year-end (potential data cutoff or operational gap).

**Business Implications**:
- The year-end drop requires investigation — potentially a data lag, shipping constraints, or seasonal slowdown
- Strong mid-year performance indicates ideal periods for campaigns and stocking

**How the Dashboard Helps**:
- Weekly chart enables visibility into sales cycles and anomalies.
- Stakeholders can correlate the quantity sold and revenue to optimise the supply-demand balance.

### **B. Product Performance: Strengths and Weaknesses**

**Findings**:
- Top categories by revenue: Jacket (£225.4M), Cardigan (£155.2M), Hoodie (£143.3M)
- Lower performers: Sweatshirt (£52.2M) and T-Shirt (£48.1M)
- Price points vary from £6 to £40 per unit

**Business Implications**:
- Strong jacket sales suggest a focus on premium outerwear; consider regional expansions or bundled winter collections.
- Underperformers may benefit from repositioning, design refresh, or targeted discounts.

**How the Dashboard Helps**:
- Dual-bar revenue chart and tooltip metrics (% revenue share, quantity sold) allow quick comparison.
- Useful for pricing reviews and SKU rationalisation.

### **C. Regional Performance and Major Clients**

**Findings**:
- Leading countries: UK (23.9%), Spain (9.4%), France (6.2%)
- Top clients: Panowikk (£26.9M), TOL Uniform, General Clothing, etc.
- Over 25 clients contribute between £24M–£27M each

**Business Implications**:
- Market concentration in the UK indicates a need to diversify regionally for risk balance.
- Client contributions are relatively flat at the top — a strong mid-tier client base should be cultivated further.

**How the Dashboard Helps**:
- Customer and country views highlight key accounts and regions
- Filters allow drilling into client behaviour and regional seasonality

### **D. Sales Channel & Logistics Impact**

**Findings**:
- Revenue by business category: Bulk (41.6%), Others (36.5%), Retail (21.9%).
- Delivery Mode split: Air, Land, Sea (35%), Land (30%), Air (25%), Sea (10%).

**Business Implications**:
- Heavy reliance on bulk buyers opens an opportunity for customised pricing and loyalty incentives.
- High usage of air freight (25%) impacts margins; shifting more volume to sea could improve cost efficiency.

**How the Dashboard Helps**:
- The business category pie chart clarifies where profit optimisation strategies should focus.
- Delivery Mode visual guides shipping and sustainability decisions.

### **E. Sustainability Initiative: Delivery Mode Strategy**

**Findings**:
- ~25% of revenue tied to air shipments; most expensive and highest carbon impact
- Combined air/land/sea mode is largest contributor (35%)

**Business Implications**:
- Reducing air dependency can lower costs and support green initiatives
- Must be balanced with delivery timelines and customer expectations

**How the Dashboard Helps**:
- The Delivery Mode chart enables simulation of the potential impact of shifting the logistics strategy
- Combined with Country/Product filters, users can identify which markets rely heavily on fast delivery

## **4. Final Business Recommendations**
