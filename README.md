- **Total Units Sold**: 62.23M
- **Profit Margin**: 44.92%
- Highest weekly revenue reached ~¬£22M; sharp dip to ¬£3M and ¬£0.16M toward year-end.

### **B. Product Performance: Strengths and Weaknesses**

**Findings**:
- Top categories by revenue: Jacket (¬£225.4M), Cardigan (¬£155.2M), Hoodie (¬£143.3M)
- Lower performers: Sweatshirt (¬£52.2M) and T-Shirt (¬£48.1M)
- Price points vary from ¬£6 to ¬£40 per unit

**Business Implications**:
- Sweatshirt and T-shirt sales underperformance may indicate pricing, branding, or market positioning issues. Strategies such as discounts, redesigns, or promotional bundles could improve demand.
- Jacket, Cardigan, and Hoodie sales dominance suggests potential expansion opportunities, such as introducing premium, limited-edition, or region-specific variations.

**How the Dashboard Helps**:
- The **Revenue by Product Category Chart** clearly distinguishes top-performing and underperforming products.
- By using the **Country Filter**, users can analyse how different product categories perform across regions.
- Combining **Month + Product Category** filters helps assess seasonality in product sales.

‚ÑπÔ∏è**ToolTip: Product-Level Financial Summary**

üìä **Profitability Assessment**: Showing product-wise profit and cost helps finance teams evaluate which products are most financially viable or eroding margins.

‚öñÔ∏è **Pricing and Cost Optimisation**: Enables informed decisions around pricing strategy or cost control initiatives to improve profit margins per product.

**ToolTip Insights**
- Jackets and Hoodies contribute significantly to both top-line revenue and bottom-line profit. Jackets, despite lower volume, deliver exceptional returns due to premium pricing. Hoodies provide balanced volume and profitability.
- T-shirts and Sweatshirts are low-margin, high-volume products. While they aid total unit sales, they do not contribute as efficiently to profitability.

**Investment Suggestion**
- Continue prioritising premium products like Jackets for margin maximisation, and Hoodies for volume-plus-profit stability. Ensure consistent availability and targeted marketing during peak demand
- Use T-Shirts and Sweatshirts as entry-level or promotional products to boost volume and attract new customers, but do not rely on them for driving profits. Consider bundling them with higher-margin items.

**ToolTip Insights**

- Jacket (¬£40) consistently leads in revenue, making it a high-value product worth sustained promotion.
- T-Shirts (¬£6) and PoloShirts (¬£15) lead in quantity sold, indicating mass appeal and potential for bundle deals or upselling.
- Hoodies maintain a stable presence in both volume and revenue, signalling a dependable mid-tier option.

- Revenue by business category: Bulk (41.6%), Others (36.5%), Retail (21.9%).
- Delivery Mode split: Air, Land, Sea (35%), Land (30%), Air (25%), Sea (10%).

**Business Implications**:
- Bulk sales profitability may require pricing adjustments to increase revenue from high-volume customers.
- Reducing air shipment reliance aligns with sustainability goals but requires monitoring for potential delivery delays or customer complaints.
- Cost savings from logistics changes should be reinvested in optimising supply chain efficiency.

**How the Dashboard Helps**:

### **E. Sustainability Initiative: Potential Impact of Reducing Air Shipments**
As part of a potential sustainability initiative, Infinity Export could consider reducing its reliance on air transport to minimise environmental impact and reduce logistics costs. The dashboard allows us to evaluate the financial impact of such a decision by analysing the revenue generated through air shipments.

**Key Assumptions**
- If Universal Export were to phase out air shipments entirely, it would impact a significant portion of total revenue.
- Air shipments account for approximately 30.18% of total logistics, meaning that a land and sea transport transition could require operational adjustments.
- Revenue dependence on air shipments (~$314M) suggests that certain product categories or customer segments might be affected disproportionately if a logistics shift is implemented.

**Projected Business Implications**
- Revenue at Risk: If all air shipments were eliminated, approximately $314M in revenue could be affected, requiring alternative logistics solutions to maintain supply chain efficiency.
- Delivery Delays: Switching from air to land/sea logistics may increase delivery times, potentially affecting customer satisfaction and order fulfilment speed.
- Cost Savings: While reducing air shipments could lower logistics costs, it would require an evaluation of whether slower transportation methods impact order volume and repeat purchases.
- Product & Market Impact: Certain high-demand, time-sensitive products (such as seasonal or promotional items) may need to remain on air transport to avoid stockout risks.

**How the Dashboard Helps Analyse This Scenario**
- The Revenue by Business Category chart allows users to explore how much revenue is currently dependent on air transport.
- By applying the Product Category filter, users can identify which products would be most impacted by a reduction in air shipments.
- The Country Filter helps analyse if certain markets rely more heavily on air shipments than others, enabling strategic adjustments in logistics planning.

This dashboard provides a framework for evaluating the feasibility of a sustainability-driven logistics shift, enabling Universal Export to assess potential trade-offs between cost savings, revenue impact, and customer service levels.

## **4. Final Business Recommendations**
- **Phase Out Underperformers**: Reassess marketing, pricing, and design for low-margin products like Sweatshirts and T-Shirts.
- **Diversify Regional Exposure**: Expand beyond the UK to reduce overdependence on a single market.
- **Monitor Logistics Impact**: Ensure shifting away from air shipments doesn‚Äôt degrade customer experience.
- **Strengthen Sales Channel Profitability**: Restructure bulk pricing models to boost margin efficiency.
- **Optimise Underperforming Products**: Streamline offerings and reinvest in higher-performing alternatives.

## **5. Next Steps**
- **Sales Forecasting**: Use predictive analytics to estimate 2025 sales trends.
- **Customer Segmentation Analysis**: Identify high-value customers and retention strategies.
- **Supply Chain Optimisation**: Evaluate how alternative shipping methods impact delivery efficiency and revenue

## **6. Conclusion**

It empowers leaders to make data-backed decisions across product strategy, logistics, and customer engagement. With clear visibility into revenue trends and operational levers, the organisation is well-positioned to refine execution and accelerate export growth into 2025.
